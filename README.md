This is a small Python project that guesses a person’s personality type based on a few short moral and logical questions.
It was made mainly for practice and fun, not as a real psychology test.

Features
1. Asks five short questions about decision-making and values
2. Calculates four traits: Logic, Empathy, Morality, and Darkness
3. Uses a simple weighted formula to create a “Darkness Index”
4. Gives one of four personality types:
  1.Idealist
  2.Empath
  3.Realist
  4.Strategist
5.Works entirely in the terminal and doesn’t need any extra libraries
6.Randomly picks an answer if the user skips a question

Requirements
Python 3.x
Standard random module (included with Python)
