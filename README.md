# Human Personality Analyzer (Simple 50-ish Questions)

This is a small Python project that asks around 40–50 short personality questions
and gives you a basic "psyche report" based on your answers.

It’s made purely for fun and learning — not a clinical or psychological test.
I built it to practice Python loops, functions, input handling, and basic logic.

## What It Does
1. Asks a set of moral, emotional, and logical questions in random order.  
2. Measures traits like Empathy, Logic, Morality, Anxiety, Self-Control, and more.  
3. Calculates overall scores (0–100%) for each trait.  
4. Gives short summaries like “You seem practical and emotionally balanced.”  
5. Optionally saves your results to a text file.  
6. Randomly guesses a neutral answer if you skip a question.
